# React Events

Just like HTML DOM events, React can perform actions based on user events. React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.

## Adding Events

- React events are written in camelCase syntax: `onClick` instead of `onclick`.
- React event handlers are written inside curly braces: `onClick={shoot}`  instead of `onclick="shoot()"`.

See the example for adding events in the `index.js` file.

## Passing Arguments

To pass an argument to an event handler, we can use an arrow function. See an example for doing so in the `index.js` file.
