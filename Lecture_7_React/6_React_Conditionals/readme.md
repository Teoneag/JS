# Conditional Rendering With React

In React, you can conditionally render components. There are three common ways to do this.

1. `if` statement
2. Logical `&&` operator
3. Ternary operator

We can use either one of these ways to decide which component to render as shown in the examples in the `index.js` file. Head over there!
