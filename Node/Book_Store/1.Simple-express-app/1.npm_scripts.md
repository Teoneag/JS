# NPM Scripts
Use NPM's handy scripts by running the following command in the terminal and following the prompts. Note that some fields can be left blank if desired.

```js
npm init
```

You will get this file:

```json
{
  "name": "nodejs-lecture",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "npm scripts",
  "main": "1.first-node.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node 4.serving_static.js"
  },
  "author": "Ujwal Gadiraju",
  "license": "ISC"
}


```

Now add a new key-value pair as follows:

```js
 "start": "node <here enter the js file you want to run>"
```

Save it and then enter in the terminal the following command:

```js
 npm start
```
