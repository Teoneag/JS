# Nodemon

Nodemon is a utility that automatically restarts a Node.js application when changes are made to the source code. 

It can be used during development to automatically reload the server whenever a change is made, saving the developer the manual step of stopping and restarting the server. 

It can be installed as a development dependency using npm.


install this package using the following:

```js
//to install it as a development package
npm install nodemon --save-dev

//For production, use this
npm install nodemon --save
```
You will notie the new dependency package:

```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.20"
  }
```

Now head over to the json file once more and replace the command `start` command with the following command:

```js
nodemon <your file name>.js
```

Restart the server with the following command in the terminal. 

```
npm start
```
