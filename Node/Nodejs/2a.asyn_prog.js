// Node.js uses asynchronous programming. Here's an example: 

setTimeout(()=> {
    console.log("Delay this cool movie quote by 2 seconds!");
}, 2000)

console.log("Hope is a good thing. Maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies.");
console.log("Which famous movie was this dialogue heard it?")
